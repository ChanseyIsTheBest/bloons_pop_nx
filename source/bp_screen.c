 * WHY Screen NEEDS HOOKING
 * ------------------------
 * Screen.width/height resolve through the Android player to the Java view
 * hierarchy, which does not exist here. Left alone they report whatever the
 * stubbed path produces -- typically 0 -- and anything laying out UI against
 * them divides by zero or places everything off-screen. cloverpit_nx records
 * catching UnityMain SPINNING because these returned wrong values, so this is
 * not merely cosmetic.
 *
 * safeArea is answered as the full rect. The Switch panel has no notch and no
 * rounded corners, so the safe area IS the screen; a game that insets its UI
 * from a wrongly-reported safe area leaves a visible band of dead space.
 *
 * MIT.
