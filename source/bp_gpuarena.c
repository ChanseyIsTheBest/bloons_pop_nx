/* bp_gpuarena.c -- dedicated contiguous arena for GPU buffers.
 *
 * Adopted from cloverpit_gpuarena.c (MIT), itself ported from pvz_fusion_nx.
 * Nothing in here is game-specific: it is a fix for how libdrm_nouveau
 * allocates, so it applies unchanged to any GLES title in this lineage.
 * Renamed identifiers only.
 *
 * WHY (this is the actual cause of the fixed-frame-count freeze)
 * libdrm_nouveau backs EVERY GPU buffer with memalign(0x1000, size). Those are
 * large (up to ~22 MB for a 1080p render target), page-aligned, and churned
 * constantly as the engine creates and destroys textures and framebuffers.
 * Serving them from newlib's general heap shreds it: once fragmented, a 20 MB
 * CONTIGUOUS page-aligned run cannot be placed even with a gigabyte free in
 * aggregate. memalign then returns NULL -> nouveau_bo_new fails ->
 * GL_OUT_OF_MEMORY -> incomplete framebuffer -> the compositor is handed
 * something invalid and the console wedges.
 *
 * That explains what nothing else did: the freeze happening at a FIXED frame
 * count (~21-26), independent of threading mode, pacing, vsync and swap
 * interval. It is not a race and not a system-memory shortage -- the memory is
 * there, it is just too fragmented to place one more big buffer. Every earlier
 * theory predicted the freeze would move when those knobs changed. It did not.
 *
 * THE FIX
 * Reserve one big contiguous region ONCE, at first GPU allocation, before the
 * heap has been churned. Hand GPU buffers out of it with a page bitmap, so they
 * can never fragment newlib and newlib can never fragment them. Small or
 * non-page-aligned requests still go to newlib.
 *
 * Ported from pvz_fusion_nx, where this is what made the game render.
 *
 * DEADLOCK NOTE, inherited and important: never call debugPrintf while holding
 * gpua_lock. Logging writes to the SD card and can allocate internally, which
 * re-enters __wrap_memalign -> gpua_alloc -> mutexLock(gpua_lock). libnx mutexes
 * are not recursive, so that self-deadlocks the calling thread. Record the
 * outcome under the lock; report it after releasing.
 *
 * MIT.
